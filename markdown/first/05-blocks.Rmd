#	Conclusion
The central question explored in this paper is, "To what extent do probabilistic fallacies affect the reliability and validity of the Bayesian approach to cognition?" I have discussed various criticisms and limitations of the Bayesian brain hypothesis, stressing that the answer is more intricate than a simple affirmative or negative. Recognizing the limitations associated with the Bayesian approach and exploring alternative frameworks is vital for a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of human cognition (Griffiths et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2010; Tenenbaum et al., 2011). Gigerenzer's experiment and others reveal that even experts grapple with identifying correct probabilities, indicating that understanding probability is complex for humans. Moreover, cognitive and emotional biases may impede the brain's ability to use Bayesian inference, leading to systematic errors in judgment. Consequently, it is crucial to approach the Bayesian brain hypothesis with humility and openness.
In this regard, Cohen's critique of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST â€“ a frequentist probability procedure) is, ironically, appliable to the epistemic (i.e., Bayes) approach to cognition:

> *What's wrong with NHST? Well, among other things, it does not tell us what we want to know, and we so much want to know what we want to know that, out of desperation, we nevertheless believe that it does (Cohen, 1994, p. 997).*

In conclusion, I advocate for a paradigm shift towards a more mindful (i.e., Gigerenzer, 2004) application of the Bayesian approach to cognition (see also Tukey, 1962; Taleb, 2008). This is not to dismiss studies supporting the Bayesian brain hypothesis but to acknowledge the challenges in evaluating the Bayesian approach, given our current methodologies and understanding of cognition. By addressing these limitations and further integrating Bayesian cognitive models with other models, we can develop a more accurate and holistic perspective on the human mind's intricacies.
