#	Discussion
In this discussion, I will summarize my findings and interpret them concerning my research question. My study aimed to explore the impact of Bayesian reasoning on the understanding of human cognition and the limitations it presents. The results have provided valuable insights. I will discuss the patterns, unexpected results, and limitations. I will also suggest future research directions in this area.

##	Interpretation of findings
The Bayesian brain hypothesis has significantly influenced cognitive science, contributing to advancements in understanding perception, decision-making, and learning. Despite its impact, the hypothesis is not a complete explanation for all aspects of human cognition.
It is important to consider the influence of fallacies and irrational thinking on human cognition, as Williams (2021) highlights the role of epistemic irrationality in the Bayesian brain, arguing that the hypothesis may not fully account for the complexities of human cognition. This raises concerns about the reliability of the Bayesian approach as a comprehensive model for understanding cognition. As McKenzie (2003) states, "it is suggested here that rational models be seen as theories, and not standards, of behavior" (p. 403). Considering the Bayesian brain hypothesis as a theoretical framework rather than an infallible standard allows for a more nuanced understanding of human cognition, taking into account the impact of fallacies and irrational thinking.
Regarding falsifiability, Friston (2010) asserts that it is not falsifiable in the same sense that natural selection is not falsifiable. However, the framework becomes very useful for generating and testing models of cognition. The Bayesian brain hypothesis has proven to be a valuable framework for understanding brain processes. Nonetheless, this necessitates further exploration and improvement of the theory based on emerging evidence and research advancements.
If we accept the premise that humans have a Bayesian brain, we need to consider whether the related fallacies and limitations could hinder our ability to use this cognitive system effectively. A reader might assume that certain fallacies are widely known or that knowledge of them is sufficient to avoid committing them. However, I argue that once a fallacy unfolds in the brain, identifying it becomes much more difficult. In a mathematical or statistical context, errors can be overlooked, but this does not apply to cognition. People tend to quickly generate explanations and make assumptions without realizing their origin, which can lead to the adoption of fallacies (Gigerenzer, 2020; Neth & Gigerenzer, 2015). As a result, one might not commit certain fallacies when conducting statistical analysis but is still susceptible to them when engaging in cognition.

##	Limitations and future directions for research
In this paper, I have discussed the limitations of the Bayesian brain hypothesis and highlighted various fallacies impacting its applicability. However, my analysis has limitations warranting further exploration. Firstly, the multi-intercorrelation of fallacies was not thoroughly investigated, as they contribute differently in various contexts and are influenced by the combination of fallacies present. Secondly, this paper presents only a selected number of fallacies, and therefore, not all the fallacies that might be relevant to the topic are discussed. Finally, only a nuanced description of the Bayesian Brain approach to cognition is provided, without delving into closely related concepts, such as free energy (Friston, 2010).

Future research should focus on improving the transparency of the Bayesian brain hypothesis and exploring and combining alternative frameworks to better understand the brain's underlying cognitive processes. This may involve further examining the relationship between neural activity and Bayesian computations (Aitchison & Lengyel, 2017), determining whether neural activity patterns can be directly linked to the Bayesian computations or if alternative explanations, such as other cognitive processes, can account for the observed neural activity. Additionally, researchers could consider alternative frameworks, such as predictive coding (Clark, 2013), which emphasizes the brain's ability to generate and update internal models of the world based on sensory input, minimizing prediction errors through a hierarchical structure (Friston, 2010). This approach may provide a more transparent link between neural activity and cognitive processes compared to the Bayesian brain hypothesis. A combination of these or other computational models in the future might control for some of the fallacies discussed in this paper and potentially lead to more accurate predictions of human cognition.
